# Human Detection using HOG and NN
    
This is an open source implementation of Human Detection using Histogram Oriented Gradient and a two layer perceptron neural network for detecting human in 2D color
images. The project consists of four steps:  
‚Ä¢ Converting color image to black and white    
‚Ä¢ Gradient operation (Prewitt's Operator)  
‚Ä¢ Compute HOG features  
‚Ä¢ Backpropogation using a two-layer perceptron  
  
There are 20 training images (10 positive and 10 negative) and 10 test images (5 positive and 5 negative) in .bmp format.  All images are of size 160 (Height) X 96 (Width). Using the parameters specified in the project description, you should have 20 X 12 cells and 19 X 11 blocks. The size of your final HOG descriptor should be 7,524 X 1.  
  
## How to compile and run the program
The only libraries used in this program is PIL and scipy in order to read and write the image, numpy in order to save the 0-255 value of each pixel location, and math to compute the square root. No other libraries or in built functions are required for any operation including convolution. 

## Functions
### Converting Color Image to Black and White  
Converted the color image into a greyscale image using the formula I =(0.299ùëÖ + 0.587ùê∫ + 0.114ùêµ) where R, G and B are the pixel values from the red, green
and blue channels of the color image.

### Gradient Operation (Prewitt's Operator)
The Prewitt‚Äôs operator is used for gradient operation. If part of the 3 x 3 masks of the Prewitt‚Äôs operator lies in the undefined region of the image after Gaussian filtering, output value is set to zero (indicates no edge).

### Compute HOG Features
Unsigned representation of HOG features is used, which means that the histogram channels are evenly spread over 0 to 180 rather than 0 to 360. Therefore, 180 is subtracted from the calculated arctan value. The HOG features are computed and stored in 9 bins for each cell.
 L2 norm is used for block normalization. If v is the non-normalized vector containing all histograms in a given block, and e is machine epsilon,

Cell size = 8 x 8 pixels
Block size = 16 x 16 pixels
Block overlap or step size = 8 pixels

### Backpropogation using a Two-Layer Perceptron  
A two layer perceptron is used with RELU being used as the activation function.
